# towny
Towny is a game that I made in Java that has minigames which the user can play in order 
to earn currency in the main game. Some of these minigames use machine learning algorithms 
to make these games harder for the user. AI learns how the user plays and exploits their
moves to make the game harder for the user. The project was meant for me to get a basic
understanding of machine learning and how to incorporate it into AI. The machine learning
is very basic, however, I created my own algorithms from scratch.
